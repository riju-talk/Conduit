I am absolutely furious right now. On June 25, 2025, I ordered a “Model X2000 Pro” from your online store, specifically because your website claimed it was brand new and top-of-the-line. Today, I received a product that is clearly second-hand, beat-up, and completely non-functional.

Let me break it down:

1. The device arrived in a dented, dirty box with greasy fingerprints all over it.  
2. When I plugged it in, it made a loud screeching noise, emitted a burning smell, and then refused to power on again.  
3. The LCD screen is cracked. It’s clearly not “new” as advertised—it’s ancient and looks like it’s been used for years.  
4. The software is outdated by at least two major versions, with multiple security patches missing. I can tell because it crashes immediately when I try to update it.  
5. Your packaging slip is dated April 2023. WHY would you ship me a two-year-old product and label it as “new” in 2025?

This is beyond unacceptable. I paid full retail price—$849.99—expecting a brand-new, fully functional unit. Instead, I received junk. I have already wasted hours trying to troubleshoot this so-called “new” device, and I’m sick of dealing with the headache you caused.

I DEMAND a full refund IMMEDIATELY and a prepaid return shipping label to send this garbage back. If I do not see a refund posted to my account within 48 hours, I will escalate this to my credit card company and report your store to the Better Business Bureau as well as the Federal Trade Commission for false advertising and consumer fraud.

Do NOT make me chase you down—fix this now.
